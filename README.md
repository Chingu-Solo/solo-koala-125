Don't really know if I'll be able to complete this project with my actual html, css and javascript skills because I'm not used to work with this technologies. I'll keep trying to complete it though it'll be quite slow.

Features working ATM:
    - Header, need to add the links
    - Main nav, just style
    - Main HTML document structure

PS: If someone ever gets to read this, as I don't really know what a README file should have and for me atm isn't a high priority task (at least it's what I hope / think), don't bother about it's content please, thank you in advance!
